name="Lazy Import"
description="Are you too much lazy to follow the importing assets workflow? I am too, and I think that machines should do for us the repeated tasks! Using this plugin, you will be able to try to:

- Create Godot PBR Materials automatically using their filenames...
- Create inherited Scenes from your GLTF, FBX...
- And now test your materials in a preconfigured Test Scene!

The plugin is about 10mb only! It will appear as a Tab in the left dock.

I created this plugin because I do not understand how to configure PBR Materials properly, so if you find some kind of error or know how to improve the results, please Contribute in my github! Thanks!
